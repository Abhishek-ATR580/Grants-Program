## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in response to the open RFP: https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/action_research_opengov.md

### Overview

The "OpenGov Insight" project aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the OpenGov governance model within the Polkadot ecosystem. Launched on Kusama in November 2022 and Polkadot in June 2023, OpenGov represents a significant shift towards decentralized decision-making. This project will analyze OpenGov’s effectiveness, review its implementations across Kusama, Polkadot, and Bifrost, and assess its impact on the ecosystem's growth. The goal is to deliver actionable insights and a strategic roadmap to refine and enhance the OpenGov system for improved governance and ecosystem development.

### Project Details

This project will:
- **Analyse OpenGov's Effectiveness**: Assess how well the OpenGov model performs in terms of decentralization and decision-making efficiency.
- **Review Implementations**: Examine how OpenGov is applied across Kusama, Polkadot, and Bifrost.
- **Evaluate Impact**: Determine OpenGov's influence on the growth and development of the Polkadot ecosystem.
- **Propose a Roadmap**: Develop actionable recommendations and a strategic roadmap for future improvements.

The goal is to provide valuable insights and a strategic plan to enhance the OpenGov system, fostering better governance and ecosystem development.

### Ecosystem Fit

**OpenGov Insight** fits into the Polkadot ecosystem by addressing the need for a thorough evaluation of the OpenGov governance model, which has been implemented on Kusama and Polkadot. The project targets Polkadot ecosystem participants, including developers, validators, and general users, who are impacted by governance decisions. It meets the need for an in-depth review of OpenGov’s effectiveness and provides actionable recommendations and a strategic roadmap for improvements. These needs were identified through community discussions, existing literature, and stakeholder feedback. While there are no directly comparable projects within Polkadot, similar efforts in other ecosystems focus on governance models, making **OpenGov Insight** unique in its comprehensive approach and focus on Polkadot’s specific governance system.

### Team's experience

- Antier is a thought-to-finish partner for customers in their blockchain journey. We advise and consult our clients on blockchain technologies and tailor solutions utilising our powerful blockchain ecosystem. We help customers experiment and deploy proof-of-concepts on blockchain technologies and incrementally expand to scale to production releases. Our thought leaders regularly educate customers, partners, CXOs on the power of blockchain for today and tomorrow.
- Workdone by Antier in Substrate ecosystem
1. Antier worked on the validator and nominator apps for substrate based blockchains to offer a unique and better user experience .
2. We have also worked on creating an optimised and homogenised design focused on improving the navigation, information architecture, user flow tasks, content design and graphic elements for a seamless and easy browsing experience.
3. We have customised the default reward mechanism in the staking pallet of the substrate chain by integrating the sustainability and reliability score(which is calculated by ESG scores and Uptime of the validators repectively) of the validators in the current reward system.
4. We were able to run EVM and WASM machines natively in the substrate chain so that the chain will be able to support both EVM(Metamask, Remix, Web3.js, etc) and WASM(WebAssembly target, INK framework, etc) tooling.
5. We were able to replicate the whole polkadot ecosystem(Relay chain, Parachains, XCM), Where parachains are use case specific chains and communicate through XCM protocol with each other.

- Our team has been proactively participating in the Substrate Stack exchange and we ask/answer question related to ink!, Substrate, parachain. We rank in the top 6% people in the Substrate Stack Exchange.

## Development Status :open_book:

**OpenGov Insight** is in the planning phase. Initial steps have been completed, including the formation of the project team and the development of the research methodology. The project is preparing to initiate a comprehensive literature review and stakeholder interviews to gather relevant data and insights. Key milestones include completing the literature review, conducting interviews, analyzing data, and drafting case studies. The project is on track to commence the data collection phase in the coming month, with the goal of delivering the final report and recommendations within the planned 6-month timeline.

## Future Plans

The project team is committed to ongoing engagement with the Polkadot ecosystem to support the continuous evolution of the OpenGov system. Long-term plans include establishing a dedicated working group or advisory board to oversee the implementation of recommendations and to monitor the impact of changes. We aim to build a community of experts and enthusiasts around governance innovations, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Additionally, the team intends to pursue further research and development opportunities to address emerging governance challenges and to contribute to the broader discourse on decentralized decision-making.
